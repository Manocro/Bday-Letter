## Project: The "Happy Birthday" Script
This repository contains a special, interactive birthday surprise built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s not just a webpage; it’s a digital love letter designed to celebrate my favorite person.

## Overview
Standard birthday cards are fine, but code is forever. This project is a front-end tribute that uses:

HTML5 for the structure of our memories.

CSS3 for the styling (because you make everything look better).

JavaScript for the interactive elements (because you're the logic behind my happiness).

## Features
Responsive Love: Looks great on any device, just like you.

Dynamic Surprises: Interactive elements that trigger special messages or animations.

Zero Bugs: Unlike my school projects, my feelings for you have no errors (well, maybe just a few console.log("I love you") statements).

## Deployment
To view the letter:

Clone the repository.

Open index.html in your favorite browser.

Prepare for a smile.

## Technical Details
The project is structured simply to ensure high performance and zero latency in delivering birthday wishes:

index.html: The heart of the message.

styles.css: The "makeup" and layout.

script.js: The "brain" of the celebration.

Note to the User: Happy Birthday! You’re the main() function of my life.
